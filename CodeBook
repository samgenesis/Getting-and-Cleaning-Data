The script run_analysis.R performs the following to clean up the data:

Merges the training and test sets to create one data set, namely train,X_train.txt with test,X_test.txt, the result of which is a data frame


Reads features.txt and extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. The result is a data frame. All measurements appear to be floating point numbers in the range (-1, 1).

Reads activity_labels.txt and applies descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

The script also labels the data set with descriptive names: all feature names (attributes) and activity names are converted to lower case, underscores and brackets () are removed. Then it merges the data frame containing features with data frames containing activity labels and subject IDs. The result is saved as merged_clean_data.txt where the first column contains subject IDs, the second column activity names.

The script creates a tidy data set with the average of each measurement for each activity and each subject. The result is saved as data_set_with_the_averages.txt / data_set_with_the_averages_rownameFALSE, where  the first column contains subject IDs, the second column contains activity names (see below), and then the averages for each attribute.
